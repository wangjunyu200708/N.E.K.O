"""Unit-test-scoped fixtures.

Why this file exists: `main_routers.shared_state._state` and the Steamworks
handle in `utils.steam_state` are process-global state. Unit tests mutate both
without a teardown hook. Tests that run later can otherwise observe a dangling
`ConfigManager` or a real Steamworks object left by an earlier test.

The `_reset_shared_state` fixture below snapshots these globals before each
unit test and restores them after, so cross-test pollution cannot happen.
Introduced in response to CodeRabbit review on PR #681 — flagged for
tests/unit/test_character_memory_regression.py and
tests/unit/test_cloudsave_autocloud_router.py, but applied globally
because the same leak pattern exists in every cloudsave/character test.

`_reset_steamworks_handle` covers the same class of leak for the process-global
Steamworks handle, which used to live in that very `_state` dict before #1270
moved it down to `utils.steam_state`. See that fixture's own docstring.

def _reset_steamworks_handle():
    """Restore the process-global Steamworks handle around every unit test.

    ``utils.steam_state`` owns the process-singleton Steamworks handle plus the
    lazy-init callback that ``main_routers.shared_state`` re-exports, and
    ``app/main_server/__init__.py`` keeps a module-global mirror of the same
    handle (``on_startup`` reads that mirror when it seeds shared state).

    Any test that drives an endpoint calling ``ensure_steamworks()`` — e.g. a
    ``TestClient`` GET on ``/api/config/steam_language`` — makes the registered
    initializer run for real. On a developer machine with Steam installed that
    call succeeds and installs a live ``STEAMWORKS`` object into *both* globals.
    Nothing tore it down, so a later test that expects a pristine ``None`` handle
    failed depending on execution order. CI never saw it: with no Steam client
    the initializer returns ``None``, so the leak is invisible there.

    Before #1270 the handle lived in ``main_routers.shared_state._state`` and the
    ``_reset_shared_state`` fixture above covered it. Moving the singleton down to
    the L1 ``utils`` layer silently dropped it out of that snapshot; this fixture
    restores the lost coverage on the state's new home.

    ``utils.steam_state``'s whole module namespace is snapshotted rather than a
    hand-listed set of names, so a global added there later is covered without
    anyone remembering to extend a checklist.

    Restoring deliberately drops any handle a test installed instead of calling
    ``STEAMWORKS.unload()`` on it, and that is not an oversight:

    * ``unload()`` runs ``SteamAPI_Shutdown``, which is *process*-global — it
      does not shut down "that instance". Unloading a handle a test created
      would therefore also invalidate the snapshot handle this fixture is in the
      middle of restoring, turning a dropped reference into a live-but-dead API.
    * Production keeps the matching rule: ``SteamCloudBundleBridge.close()``
      (utils/steam_cloud_bundle.py) unloads only ``_owned_steamworks``, the
      handle it constructed itself, and never one that was passed in. A fixture
      restoring a snapshot is by definition not the owner.

    Dropping the reference is also strictly better than the status quo it
    replaces: with the fixture in place the unit suite performs *zero* real
    ``STEAMWORKS()`` initializations (measured; it was two without it), because
    restoring ``_steamworks_initializer`` closes the lazy-init path as well.

    ``sys.path`` is process-global, and several product entry points prepend to

    (app/agent_server/plugin_host.py) inserts ``<repo>/plugin`` at index 1 so the
    embedded server can import ``plugin.server.http_app``. In a real agent process
    that entry is meant to stay for the process lifetime; in a unit test that calls
    the function directly it stays for the rest of the session.

    The leaked entry is not inert. ``<repo>/plugin`` ships its own ``config``
    package, and under pytest the repo root is not ``sys.path[0]`` — the rootdir
    insertions for ``tests`` and ``tests/unit/asr_client`` sit in front of it, so
    a hardcoded index 1 lands *ahead* of the repo root. Every fresh resolution of
    ``config`` then finds ``plugin/config``, and that includes ``importlib.reload``,
    which re-runs the finder and rebinds the module object in place. So
    ``launcher_core.runtime._reload_runtime_config_from_env`` — whose entire job is
    to refresh the negotiated ``NEKO_*`` ports — reloaded ``plugin/config`` into the
    root ``config`` module and left every port at its pre-negotiation value. That
    is how ``test_runtime_config_reload_preserves_negotiated_fallback_ports``
    turned red under seed 31337 while passing on its own.

    The whole list is snapshotted rather than a named entry removed, so path leaks
