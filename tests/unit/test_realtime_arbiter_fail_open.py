"""The arbiter's escalation policy: tear down by default, keep the connection
only when that is defensible.

Contracts, written so each can be falsified:

1.  **The default never changes.** Without the environment switch the arbiter
    behaves exactly as it always has, including the
    ``response arbiter failing closed`` line that attributes a field
    disconnect (issue #2561).

2.  **Fail-open applies only when the connection can be kept.** That means
    both halves: the transport is still usable, AND the arbiter can still
    tell whose events are whose. Five things falsify it, each with a paired
    case here so "always stand down" cannot pass for correct:

    - the queue consumer is suspended inside a transport write
    - a transport write just failed
    - the abandoned response has no id to attribute its later events by
    - an announced server-VAD response has no id yet
    - an unowned response is live with no id at all

3.  **A released turn is ended, not merely dropped.** The host runs the same
    end-of-turn work its terminal event drives — because it is the same
    implementation, not a second one.

4.  **A released turn's end-of-turn work lands on that turn, or not at all.**
    The lane can reopen mid-notification — the abandoned response's own
    terminal releases it — and the host's own turn can start from outside the
    arbiter entirely. So the guarantee is identity, not ordering: the host
    takes the released turn's id and its turn epoch, and stops the moment a
    new turn has started. The release still opens the lane last, which is why
    the ordering holds in the ordinary case.

The previous attempt (withdrawn PR #2592) grew these as separate boolean
conditions patched in over seven review rounds; see #2583 for how the 20
findings collapse into five invariants once they are read together.
