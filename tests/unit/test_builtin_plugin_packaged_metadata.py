"""Guard: a built-in plugin's packaged metadata must still describe its source.

``plugin.meta.json`` is the only place a plugin's ``@plugin_entry`` list is
written down for the host -- ``plugin.toml`` carries no entries table, because
entries are derived from decorators at build time. The host verifies that file
against the source tree before trusting it (see
``plugin/server/infrastructure/packaged_metadata.py``); on a mismatch it drops
the whole thing and falls back to the manifest, which leaves the plugin
advertising *zero* entries. Anything that resolves an entry from registry
metadata rather than from the live plugin process then breaks -- most visibly
hosted UI actions, which fail with "UI action '<id>' is not a plugin entry".

Not hypothetical: #3081 edited ``game_agent_minecraft``'s source without
rebuilding its metadata, and that plugin's own status button was dead on every
install until the metadata was rebuilt. Nothing caught it, which is why this
test exists.

To fix a failure here::

    neko-plugin build <plugin> --keep-staging
    # then copy the staged plugin.meta.json back over plugin/plugins/<plugin>/

A plugin whose directory holds untracked files (a plugin writing its own runtime
state next to its source) cannot be checked from a developer working tree: those
files count toward the fingerprint but are not part of the commit. Those are
skipped here and still fully checked in CI, whose checkout has none of them.

The line-ending guard below is the other half, and it is what makes this test
useful on Windows. ``source_bytes`` counts raw bytes, so a metadata file built
against a CRLF working tree records a byte total that no real checkout has:
``.gitattributes`` pins these files to LF, so the committed content, CI, and
every shipped build see the LF total. Comparing metadata against the working
tree alone would agree with itself on such a machine and only fail elsewhere --
which is exactly what happened here, with metadata rebuilt on a tree an editor
had rewritten with CRLF.
