"""Teardown ownership: a cancelled caller must not strand an open connection.

Three teardown paths detached their resource first and awaited the slow part
afterwards, so a cancel landing in between took the only reference with it:

- ``OmniRealtimeClient.close()`` detaches ``self.ws`` before awaiting the
  arbiter shutdown (deliberately — no ticket may outlive the socket);
- ``_close_failed_transport()`` does the same on the fatal path;
- ``_close_gemini()`` cleared the SDK context manager in a ``finally``, which
  runs on cancel too — and an interrupted ``__aexit__()`` cannot be retried
  anyway, so the exit itself must not be interrupted;
- ``_cleanup_pending_session_resources()`` cleared ``pending_session`` in a
  ``finally`` while ``_reset_preparation_state`` cancels its caller a *second*
  time when its 2s wait expires — landing inside that very close.

Every canceller here is internal: a hot-swap final task or background prep
task cancelled by a concurrent start/end_session. Reported as items 12-14 of
the #2602 index.

Outliving the caller means a teardown can also outlive its connection, so the
other half is scope: it releases what it detached, and keeps its hands off the
client-wide state a replacement connection has since taken over.
