"""Escalation is scoped to the lifecycle its caller observed.

The contract, stated so it can be falsified:

    An escalation acts on the request whose failure its caller watched, at
    most once. If that request is no longer the one the arbiter is running,
    or has already been escalated over, the escalation does nothing — no
    transport teardown, no lane release, no ticket failed.

The "at most once" half is not decoration: several callers can be waiting on
the same stuck request and their timeouts fire independently. Under today's
teardown a repeat is merely noise, but every effect an escalation grows from
here — releasing a lane, finalizing a host turn — is one that must not happen
twice to the same turn.

Every escalation site in the arbiter is reached by waiting on one specific
request's timeout. By the time that timeout fires the arbiter may have moved
on: the stuck lifecycle finished, the worker picked up the next queued item,
and ``_current``/``_response_owner`` now name a healthy turn. Escalating on
"whatever is current" then tears down that healthy turn instead — which is
how two concurrent cancellers cost an extra request each time.

This was the structural gap behind several findings on PR #2592 (see
#2583 for the full catalogue): patching individual state conditions could not
fix it, because the state is shared and the request is the real scope.
