"""Concurrency / race-condition tests for ``main_routers/game_router``.

These cover the audit findings B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B8 (B4 is a defensive
guard verified in ``test_game_context_organizer.py``; B7 was landed in
PR #1125), plus three PR #1127 follow-up tests:

  guards CodeRabbit's per-lanlan supersede-lock finding.
- ``test_game_session_create_lock_evicted_with_session`` guards codex's

- ``test_character_switch_finalize_blocks_concurrent_route_start_for_same_lanlan``
  guards codex's ``finalize_game_routes_for_character`` snapshot-without-

    reusing the user-facing ``(lanlan, game_type, session_id)`` cannot land
    on the same ``_game_sessions`` slot.

    Pre-fix race window:
    1. ``_complete_game_end_from_payload`` finalizes route → closes
       original session, releases ``end_route_lock`` and supersede lock.
    2. ``_run_game_chat(allow_postgame=True)`` builds entry_pg, registers

    ``finalize_game_routes_for_character`` must serialize with concurrent
    ``/route/start`` calls for the same ``lanlan_name`` via the per-lanlan
    supersede lock — otherwise a route activated AFTER finalize's snapshot
    escapes cleanup and the character switch completes with an old-character
    route still alive.

    Pre-fix shape: ``finalize_game_routes_for_character`` snapshots
    ``_game_route_states`` BEFORE acquiring any supersede lock. A
    concurrent ``/route/start`` for the same ``lanlan_name`` could:
      1. land its activation between the snapshot and the iterate step,
      2. miss being included in the snapshot,
      3. survive the character switch unfinalized.

    Post-fix shape: finalize takes ``_route_supersede_locks[lanlan_name]``
    (the OUTER lock per the lock-ordering rule documented in
    ``utils/game_route_state.py``) BEFORE snapshotting. Any concurrent
    ``/route/start`` for the same lanlan_name blocks on that lock until
    cleanup finishes; the new route either lands strictly before the
    snapshot (in which case finalize observes and cleans it) or strictly
    after (in which case finalize already returned).

    This test forces the race by externally holding the supersede lock
    while ``finalize_game_routes_for_character`` is in flight, and then
    firing a concurrent ``/route/start``. With the fix, finalize must
    block on the supersede lock until we release it; without the fix,
    finalize would complete immediately because it never tries to take
    the lock.
