"""``group_ban`` notices: a **third party's** ban/unban must travel upstream.

Before this change the connector dropped that case outright:

    if not is_whole_group and not is_self:
        return  # someone else muted; not our concern

so the plugin could never learn that someone in the group had been muted, and reacting to
"the person she is talking with got muted" was not implementable. Now a third party's
ban/unban is enqueued (the plugin decides whether to say anything), while her own or a
whole-group mute stays local bookkeeping only -- she cannot speak in that state anyway.

The normalization is pinned here too: a poke arrives as ``notice_type=notify,
sub_type=poke``, whereas ``group_ban``'s ``sub_type`` is ``ban``/``lift_ban`` (which kind
of ban it is, not which kind of event). Taking the event name from ``sub_type`` would make
the notice unrecognizable upstream.

The plugin repository carries a fallback copy of this connector
(``_vendor/connection_onebot/onebot_client.py``) whose shape is guarded by
``tests/test_qq_group_ban_notice.py``; the two must change together.
Follows ``tests/unit`` conventions: sync tests via ``asyncio.run``, no real sockets.
