"""Native-path regression cover for ``RealtimeResponseArbiter``.

``RealtimeResponseArbiter`` arrived with the independent-ASR work, but it is
NOT gated on it: ``OmniRealtimeClient.__init__`` constructs one
unconditionally, and every realtime response now goes through it --
``create_response``, tool results, proactive chat, Gemini's manual-VAD commit
and interruption. A user who never enables independent ASR is on this code
path for every single turn.

The independent-ASR tests cover the arbiter richly from the ASR side. What
was missing was the other side: that a plain native turn, with no external
voice turns anywhere, still behaves exactly as it did before the queue
existed. The only pre-existing native assertion touching it was LOOSENED to
accommodate the arbiter's new ``event_id`` stamp, and the proactive-chat
integration tests were not touched at all.

These tests therefore assert the boring things on purpose: the event reaches
the socket, in order, once, with nothing else added; the ticket resolves; the
lane is released; and none of the new failure machinery (idle wait, ack
barrier, done timeout, transport fail-close) fires on a turn that is simply
working. A regression in any of those would be invisible to the ASR suites
and would hit every user.
