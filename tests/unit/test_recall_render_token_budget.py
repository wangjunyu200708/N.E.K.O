"""Guards for the L21 recall-block render budget.

``/query_memory`` results go straight into a prompt. Before this the only
bound was "take the first 5"; a single merged reflection could be
arbitrarily long, so the block had no ceiling at all.

There is now ONE renderer — ``memory.recall_render.render_recall_block``.
The QQ plugin's ``render_relevant_memory`` and the main app's
``recall_memory`` tool handler are thin shells over it. That collapse is
what these tests rest on, and it is why they look different from the
version this file shipped with:

Until issue #2588 the two shells were hand-written twins, and the guard
against a third un-budgeted renderer was structural — parse the repo, find
functions that render recall lines, check they CALL the two budget
functions. That inference was defeated five times running (substring match,
module-wide AST walk, a dead helper nested inside the renderer, a budget
call parked in a return annotation, one parked in ``if False:``), and an
adversarial pass then measured 12 more ways through, up to 95x over budget.
The root problem is not fixable by tightening: "will this call execute, and
is its result used" is undecidable, and each tightening also produced false
positives that invite someone to weaken the guard later.

So the budget is no longer inferred from source shape. It is measured, on
the single render path, by the behavioural tests below — oversized input in,
``count_tokens`` on what comes out. Two much cruder structural checks
remain, and neither has to reason about execution: nobody but the entry
point may call the recall label table, and every module that talks to
``/query_memory`` must import the entry point.
