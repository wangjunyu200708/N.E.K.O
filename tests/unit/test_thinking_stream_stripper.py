"""``ThinkingStreamStripper`` — streaming-safe sibling of
``strip_thinking_segments``.

Focus (thinking-on) turns stream token-by-token straight into TTS + UI, so the
Qwen3.5/3.6/3.7 hybrid leak (whole chain-of-thought dumped into ``content``
ending in a lone ``</think>``) can't wait for the non-streaming cleanup. The
stripper holds content until the first close tag, drops everything up to and
including it, then passes the real answer through. Clean providers route
reasoning to ``reasoning_content`` and never get a stripper (see
``leaks_thinking_in_content``).
