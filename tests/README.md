# N.E.K.O. Automated Test Suite

This directory contains the automated test suite for Project N.E.K.O.

## Voice input test organization

- `unit/asr_runtime/` groups Core/independent ASR tests by routing, endpointing,
  overlap/pre-roll, delivery, ownership, cancellation, and recovery.
- `unit/activation/` keeps activation tests together; handoff tests are grouped
  by success, failure, cancellation, and authority.
- `unit/websocket_static/` groups frontend source contracts and Node harness
  tests by status, preview, settings synchronization, and session/microphone control.
  The Node CI shard also runs the microphone recovery route harness in
  `tests/frontend/test_game_voice_control_runtime.js`.
- `support/` contains shared fakes and environment construction. Package-local
  `_scenarios.py` modules retain shared helpers with scenario assertions; helpers
  used by only one test module stay in that module.

Keep the existing test names, decorators, fixture scopes, and module markers
when moving tests. In ASR files, `_contract` and `_runtime` suffixes preserve the
`unit_fast` and `runtime` CI populations. Frontend `_contract` and `_process`
suffixes distinguish source checks from subprocess tests where a theme has both.
The CI shards discover `tests/unit` recursively and select by marker.

Prefer behavior boundaries over a fixed line count. In particular,
`unit/websocket_static/test_settings_cas_conflict.py` exceeds 1,000 lines because
its single original test embeds a complete Node scenario. It remains intact to
preserve its assertions and event ordering. Several other settings files contain
only one or two substantial Node scenarios for the same reason; small source
contracts stay separate from runtime/subprocess tests to preserve their CI markers.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Fast Python package installer and resolver)

## Setup

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

2.  **Install Playwright browsers** (for frontend and e2e tests):
    ```bash
    uv run playwright install
    ```

3.  **Prepare API Keys**:
    -   Copy `tests/api_keys.json.template` to `tests/api_keys.json`.
    -   Fill in your API keys (OpenAI, Qwen, etc.).

4.  **Prepare Test Data** (optional, for vision tests):
    -   Place a screenshot at `tests/test_inputs/screenshot.png`.
    -   See `tests/test_inputs/script.md` for recording scripts.

## Running Tests

> **IMPORTANT**: All commands must be run using `uv run` to ensure the correct environment.

### Run All Tests (excluding e2e)
```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -s
```

### Run Unit Tests Only
Tests for `OmniOfflineClient`, `OmniRealtimeClient`, and provider API connectivity.
```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit -s
```

### Run Human-Like Multi-Model Evaluation
Standalone framework for evaluating naturalness, empathy, lifelikeness, continuity, and low AI-ness across multiple chat models.
```bash
uv run python tests/unit/run_human_like_multi_model_eval.py
```
See `tests/unit/README_human_like_eval.md` for full documentation.

### Run Frontend Integration Tests
Tests for Settings, Character Manager, Memory Browser, Voice Clone, and Emotion Manager pages.
```bash
uv run pytest tests/frontend -s
```

### Run End-to-End (E2E) Tests
Full user journey tests (requires `--run-e2e` flag):
```bash
uv run pytest tests/e2e --run-e2e -s
```

## Key Fixtures

| Fixture | Scope | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `loaded_api_keys` | session | Loads API keys from `api_keys.json` |
| `clean_user_data_dir` | session | Temp directory for isolated config/memory |
| `running_server` | session | Starts the FastAPI backend on a random port |
| `mock_page` | function | Playwright page with error monitoring |
| `llm_judger` | session | LLM-based test output evaluator |

## Markers

| Marker | Flag |Description |
|---|---|---|
| `unit` | (none) | Unit tests, run by default |
| `frontend` | (none) | Frontend integration tests, run by default |
| `e2e` | `--run-e2e` | End-to-end tests, skipped unless flagged |
| `manual` | `--run-manual` | Manual tests, skipped unless flagged |
## LLM Judger & Reports

The test suite includes an **LLM Judger** (`tests/utils/llm_judger.py`) that evaluates the quality and correctness of AI responses using various LLM providers (OpenAI, SiliconFlow, Qwen, GLM) with automatic fallback.

### Evaluation Modes

| Mode | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Single-check | `judge()` | Evaluates one input→output pair against criteria (YES/NO) |
| Conversation | `judge_conversation()` | Evaluates a full multi-turn conversation holistically with 5-dimension scoring |

**Conversation Quality Dimensions** (each scored 1-10):
- Coherence, Context Retention, Character Consistency, Response Quality, Engagement

### Report Generation
When tests involving the `llm_judger` are run, results are collected and a **narrative report** is generated at the end of the test session.

- **Storage Location**: `tests/reports/`
- **File Format**: 
  - `test_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`: Machine-readable results with full input/output/verdicts/scores.
  - `test_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`: **LLM-generated narrative report** with executive summary, detailed analysis, and recommendations. Falls back to table format if LLM is unavailable.

### LLM Provider Configuration
The judger uses keys defined in `tests/api_keys.json`. It will attempt to use providers in order of preference and skip those with missing or placeholder keys (e.g., `sk-...`).

## Human-Like Evaluation Framework

This repository also includes a separate human-like multi-model evaluation framework focused on:

- naturalness
- empathy
- lifelikeness
- context retention
- engagement
- persona warmth
- AI-ness penalty

It has its own:

- scenario bank
- persona presets
- batch runner
- Chinese judging prompts
- normalized 100-point overall score
- report generation flow

Documentation:

- `tests/unit/README_human_like_eval.md`

Important:

- Future changes to this framework should be documented in `tests/unit/README_human_like_eval.md`.

## Unit test shards

Pull requests run the four behavior markers in `unit-test-shards.yml`, while
`unit-tests.yml` runs the remaining unmarked unit tests:
`unit_fast`, `runtime`, `integration_serial`, and `frontend_contract`, plus the
Node frontend contract test. The same shard job also runs the root-level
`tests/unit/*.test.js` node:test suites, which pytest never collects. Each
Python shard performs a non-empty collection check before execution. The full
`tests/unit` gate runs on pushes to `main` and
manual dispatch, avoiding duplicate 45-minute execution on pull requests.
