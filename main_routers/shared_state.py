Shared State Module

This module provides access to shared state variables (session managers, etc.)
that are initialized in the main_server package but need to be accessed by routers.

Design: Routers import getters from this module, main_server sets the state
after initialization.

History
-------
Issue #857 / PR #855 review consolidated 6 parallel per-catgirl module-globals
in main_server (sync_message_queue / sync_shutdown_event / session_id /
sync_process / websocket_locks / session_manager) into a single
``role_state: dict[str, RoleState]`` container. To avoid touching dozens of
consumer call-sites in this PR, the legacy getters
(``get_sync_message_queue`` etc.) are kept and now return a thin
``_RoleStateFieldView`` adapter — a ``MutableMapping`` view over one field of
each ``RoleState`` entry. Consumers see the same dict-like API
(``[k]`` / ``in`` / ``del`` / ``.keys()`` / ``.items()`` / ``.get()`` / ``.pop()``).

A new ``get_role_state()`` getter exposes the underlying container directly
for code that wants to migrate off the per-field views.

class _RoleStateFieldView(MutableMapping):
    """Dict-like view over a single field of every ``RoleState`` entry.

    Backward-compatibility shim for legacy ``get_sync_message_queue()`` /
    ``get_session_id()`` etc. callers. Holds a reference to the live
    ``role_state`` dict and a field name; reads/writes proxy to
    ``role_state[k].<field>``.

    Semantics
    ---------
    ``__contains__(k)`` returns True iff ``k in role_state`` AND the field
    value is not ``None``. This preserves the legacy "the dict has no entry
    for this catgirl" check used by code like::

        if lanlan_name not in session_id: ...
        if lanlan in session_manager: ...

    For lazily-populated fields (session_id / session_manager) this matches
    the historical "dict had no key" state; sync_message_queue is created
    eagerly with each slot, so for it contains is equivalent to
    ``k in role_state``.

    ``__delitem__(k)`` clears the field by setting it to ``None``; it does
    NOT remove the underlying ``role_state`` entry. Removing the whole
    catgirl goes through ``del role_state[k]`` in
    ``_cleanup_character_dicts``. This matches the only consumer ``del`` /
    ``pop`` site we have today (``session_id.pop(lanlan_name, None)`` in
    ``websocket_router``), which means "this catgirl no longer has a live
    session" — not "delete the catgirl".

    Consumers must never assign ``sync_message_queue`` through this view:
    ``RoleState`` builds it once per slot and never replaces it (see the
    ``RoleState`` invariants in app/main_server/character_runtime.py). The
    view does not actively block such writes — it relies on convention +
    code review.
