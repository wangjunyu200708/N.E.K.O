WebSocket Router

Handles WebSocket endpoints including:
- Main WebSocket connection for chat
- Proactive chat
- Task notifications

URL convention: WebSocket routes (``@router.websocket('/ws/...')``) follow the
same no-trailing-slash rule as HTTP routes. See
``main_routers/characters_router.py`` docstring or
``.agent/rules/neko-guide.md`` (§"API URL 末尾不带斜杠") for the rationale;
enforced by ``scripts/check_api_trailing_slash.py``.
