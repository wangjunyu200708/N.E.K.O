"""
Direct bridge into ``libsteam_api`` for ``ISteamUGC::DownloadItem``.

The bundled ``SteamworksPy`` wrapper library does not export
``Workshop_DownloadItem``; without it, items the user has *subscribed* to
will never have their files downloaded by Steam — subscription alone does
not initiate a download. ``ISteamUGC::DownloadItem`` is the API that asks
the Steam client to actually fetch (or queue) the content.

We bind to ``libsteam_api`` directly via ``ctypes``. That library is already
present in-process because the SteamworksPy wrapper depends on it, so we
share the same Steam runtime state — no separate ``SteamAPI_Init`` is
required here.
