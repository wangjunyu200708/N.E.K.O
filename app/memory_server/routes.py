    The persona and facts persistence paths are **asymmetric**, because their

    - **facts** take the ``_apersist_new_facts(semantic_dedup=False)`` pure-append
      path -- the facts pool has no hard token ceiling for system-prompt rendering;
      entries are recalled on demand at retrieval time, so keeping each one is fine.
    - **persona** must first go through one LLM fusion via ``afuse_external_facts``.
      When persona is rendered into the system prompt, all non-protected entries
      compete for a single **strict token ceiling**; ``USER.md`` / ``SOUL.md`` are
      dozens of lines of free-form Markdown, and appending them verbatim would
      quickly overflow that pool and crowd out the impressions the character has
      naturally accumulated in conversation. Fusion summarises / merges / dedupes
      the material and truncates it to the per-entity budget before persisting.
      Candidates are grouped by entity (master / neko) and fused separately.

    On fusion failure (``ExternalMemoryFusionError``) there is **no fallback** to
    per-entry appends (that would bypass the budget and overflow the pool) -- the
    user's material is kept and ``external_import_partial`` is returned so the
    frontend can retry; retries are idempotent (same fingerprint -> skip the whole
    batch / changed -> replace-then-fuse).

    the Stage-1 fact_extract LLM — RFC §3.4.3 explicitly says "per-turn
    extract_facts is too expensive; move to background scheduling"; batch
    extraction is done by ``_periodic_signal_extraction_loop``, which pulls a
    window from ``time_indexed.db`` and runs Stage-1+Stage-2 at 10 accumulated
    turns or 5 min idle; nor does it run the review LLM rewriting history (that
    category is still run by /settle at session renew).

    History — commit cba377c5 ("Fix/memory hotswap timing", 2026-03-29)
    introduced /settle and gated "the LLM follow-up work left over from cache"
    entirely behind ``if input_history``, but cross_server's standard rhythm is
    "turn end /cache → renew session /settle(msgs=0)", so settle always received
    msgs=0 and both ``store_conversation`` and the outbox extract were silently
    skipped: ``time_indexed.db`` was never created (time perception broken) +
    ``outbox.ndjson`` / ``events.ndjson`` / ``facts.json`` never created
    (long-term memory + the evidence-RFC chain idling completely), **and the
    batch loop, which depends on the db for history, was paralyzed with it**.

    The fix moves store + post-turn signals back into the cache endpoint; at the
    same time the Stage-1 per-turn fact_extract that PR-1 had temporarily kept
    for "short-term behavior parity" (the ``legacy flow``) is migrated out too —
    the RFC always planned for only ``_periodic_signal_extraction_loop`` to run
    fact extraction. ``astore_conversation`` is a SQLite INSERT (~ms scale), and
    ``_spawn_outbox_post_turn_signals`` now only runs counter bump + local
    repetition sniffing + check_feedback (LLM only when surfaced has pending
    entries) — an ndjson append + spawned background task (non-blocking).
    ``cache`` keeps its "no LLM latency in the foreground" lightweight semantics,
    **and is lighter than the PR-1 implementation** — the per-turn fact_extract
    LLM waste is fully gone.

    ⚠️ `subjects` ORDER IS THE BUDGET PRIORITY. The renderer allocates the
    overall scoped gate (`SCOPED_RENDER_TOTAL_MAX_TOKENS`) strictly first-
    come-first-served down this list, and a subject that arrives after the
    gate has dropped below `SCOPED_RENDER_SUBJECT_MIN_TOKENS` loses its
    whole section — not a shortened version, the whole thing, because half
    a persona reads to the model as a complete one. No subject kind is
    special-cased; an earlier attempt to reserve a slice for a group
    subject queued behind its members was deleted because every one of its
    interactions was a way to invert the order it was meant to protect.

    One exception, and it is deliberate: a subject whose only content is
    budget-EXEMPT (`protected` character-card lines, `suppress`ed
    do-not-mention entries) still renders when the gate is spent. Those
    sections never cost the gate anything, so there is no fragment to
    avoid — and dropping them would take a do-not-mention list with it,
    after which the character volunteers exactly what it was told to sit
    on. Only subjects with budgeted content they cannot afford are dropped
    whole. See `test_a_group_holding_only_suppressed_facts_still_renders_them`.

    So the caller owns the ranking. The one shipped caller
    (`session_instruction_service._build_core_memory_section`, via
    `memory_bridge.fetch_scoped_bootstrap_memory`) sends the group subject
    FIRST and then at most one `group_participant` for the current
    speaker. If a later PR widens that to several recent speakers, the
    group still has to lead. That is a contract, not a coincidence — send
    members first and the group's own persona is what falls off the end.

    Deliberately not validated here: rejecting an order would turn a
    ranking choice into a 422 for callers with a legitimately different one
    (a private-DM-style render with no group subject at all is already
    valid input). The endpoint accepts 1..8 subjects in any order; what it
    does NOT do is second-guess the order it was given.
