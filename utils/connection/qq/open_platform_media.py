"""QQ Open Platform rich media: image upload and image sending.

Sending an image over the Open Platform is two requests, not one: upload the bytes
to get a ``file_info``, then send a ``msg_type=7`` message carrying it. Both halves
are QQ-platform-specific, so they live here next to
:mod:`utils.connection.qq.open_platform` rather than in the platform-neutral
``base`` layer.

Two upload protocols coexist on this platform:

1. **Legacy direct upload** -- ``POST /v2/{scope}/{id}/files`` with
   ``file_type`` / ``file_name`` / ``file_size`` / ``mime_type``, answering with an
   ``upload_url`` to ``PUT`` the bytes to. This is what the connection used to do
   for group images; the current platform docs no longer list those request fields,
   and a live run on 2026-09-26 showed the group flow failing on it (the image
   silently degraded to a plain text placeholder).
2. **Documented upload** -- either a **URL upload** (hand the platform an http(s)
   address and let it fetch), or a **chunked upload**
   (``upload_prepare`` -> per-part ``PUT`` + ``upload_part_finish`` -> merge).
   A local file cannot use the URL flow.

So for local files both are attempted, legacy first: that keeps the previously
working deployment working, and whichever succeeds is named in the log, which is how
"which protocol is still alive" gets answered without guessing. A live run on
2026-09-27 reproduced it -- the log recorded the legacy attempt getting no
``file_info`` and the chunked upload then succeeding, so the chunked path is the live
one.

A legacy apply request that the platform answers with **nothing** -- a success status,
a JSON object with no error code and no ``upload_url`` -- is remembered for the rest of the connection
(``_legacy_upload_unsupported``): that is what the 2026-09-27 live run got, and retrying
it for every image only buys a guaranteed-failing request per send. Every other failure
(a 4xx such as a too-large file or an unreachable target, an error code, a failing PUT)
can be about this one image or target, so it only sends that image down the chunked
path. The per-protocol log line still fires the first time,
and ``connect()`` / a successful reconnect clear the flag, so a platform that brings the old
flow back is picked up again.

Sources
-------

``upload_image`` takes an http(s) URL (URL upload), a ``base64://`` payload (the OneBot
``image`` segment convention), or a local path / ``file://`` URI (chunked upload).

Shape
-----

The actions sit on :class:`QQOpenPlatformMediaMixin`, the same way the
NapCat / go-cqhttp extensions sit on ``NapCatActionsMixin``: the connection class
stays about the protocol, and a platform's extras stay in one place next to it.

Anything that needs these actions only has to hold the connection object, so a
consumer that owns its own connection -- or holds one the host handed it -- can call
them without importing this module. Failure returns ``""`` / ``None`` instead of
raising: the caller decides how to degrade (the group and private message paths in
``open_platform`` fall back to a plain text placeholder).

Dependencies
------------

Connection members only: ``_http``, ``_API_BASE``, ``_ensure_token()``,
``_auth_headers()``, ``logger``, and ``record_sent_message_id()`` for the send half.
