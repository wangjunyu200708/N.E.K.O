"""Keep chained screen-source narration out of the request view.

When an assistant message carries a confirmed chain, the request view keeps
only its first comment, as plain prose: every source label is removed, the
text before the chain stays, and everything from the second comment on is
dropped. The cut lands on that comment's sentence end, so what remains is a
whole sentence in the character's own voice, not a truncated fragment. A
chain spread over the assistant run before the current turn is rewritten the
same way across the run. A saved transcript is never rewritten, and no user
wording restores a removed comment. This removes the sample the model would
otherwise copy from, which is what feeds the observed propagation: polluted
history in, imitated chains out.

Detection needs a labelled, multi-item chain whose comments reach
``MIN_PROSE``. Unlabelled history and comments below that threshold pass
through unchanged and silently; see the incident record's applicability
and failure-boundary section for the measured limits.

This module deliberately does **not** filter this turn's own output. The
measured propagation stops once the stimulus is removed, so an output-side
guard is a fallback, not the causal fix; adding one without a correct
boundary story would trade a visible chain for truncated legitimate text.
