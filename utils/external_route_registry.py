"""Registry of external routes that can take over a character's input.

An external route is a controller outside the ordinary chat session (today
only the mini-game route) that, while active, owns the character's typed and
spoken input. Before this registry every hijack point imported the game
router directly; a second kind of controller would have had to copy each of
those branches. Hijack points now ask the registry instead:

- input hijack (``websocket_router`` stream_data / start_session, the
  auto-start gate in ``main_logic/core/streaming.py``, the independent ASR
  voice consumer) and the proactive / context-prompt gates look only at
  ``is_active``;
- slot checks (a new route asking whether it may start) look at
  ``is_locked``, which a kind can keep true while its exit flow is still
  running after ``is_active`` has turned false.

``is_character_lifecycle_locked`` is the predicate for a character
rename / delete guard; no endpoint consults it yet.

The registry stores callables only. It lives in ``utils/`` so that
``main_logic/`` can consult it without importing ``main_routers/``; route
owners register themselves when their module is imported.

    """Callables one kind of external route plugs into the shared hijack points.

    ``route_voice_transcript`` receives ``(lanlan_name, transcript, **route_kwargs)``
    exactly as the independent ASR consumer passes them, so a kind can register
    its pre-existing handler object unchanged. ``current_instance`` (required)
    returns an opaque id of the route instance currently active for the
    character (e.g. a session id): every dispatch that awaits a handler
    re-checks ``(kind, instance)`` afterwards, and independent-ASR turns are
    pinned to it, so a decision or utterance of one instance never carries over
    to the next instance of the same kind. ``is_locked`` defaults to
    ``is_active``; ``has_background_tasks`` defaults to "never".

    Microphone PCM on the main socket is announced to the route as
    ``{"input_type": "audio", "stt_provider": "realtime"}``. When the route
    returns True the PCM is dropped, unless the kind sets ``audio_passthrough``,
    in which case it keeps flowing to the ordinary realtime session.

    ``on_start_session`` lets a kind decide a frontend session start itself.
    A kind that leaves it None gets the default start handling while active:
    a text start is only acknowledged (no ordinary text session starts), and an
    audio start announces ``stt_provider="realtime"`` to the route and starts
    the ordinary realtime session as the route's speech-to-text provider. That
    session is useless unless the microphone PCM reaches it, so such a kind
    must set ``audio_passthrough`` (checked at registration).
