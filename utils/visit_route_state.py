"""Shared visit-route state primitives (sibling of ``utils/game_route_state.py``).

Lives in ``utils/`` so that both ``main_logic/`` and ``main_routers/`` can
read whether a character is out visiting (or hosting a visitor) without a
reverse-direction import. The visit runtime owns the heavy lifecycle; this
module only holds the per-character state container and its lock.

One character is in at most one visit at a time (OD-03), so the key is the
bare ``lanlan_name``. A slot exists from the moment a visit is reserved
(``phase='pending'``, before credentials are fetched) until it is finalized:
a pending placeholder already counts as active so that a second room or a
mini game cannot grab the same character in between.
