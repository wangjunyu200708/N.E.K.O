"""Shared game-route state primitives.

Lives in ``utils/`` so that ``main_logic/`` can read route state and dispatch
voice transcripts into the active route without importing from
``main_routers/`` (which would invert the framework layering: lower-level
domain logic should not depend on the HTTP router layer).

``main_routers/game_router.py`` owns the heavy lifecycle (LLM dispatch,
finalize, archive, organizer). This module only holds:

- the global ``_game_route_states`` container
- the small read helpers used by both layers
- a registration hook so ``game_router`` can plug its voice-transcript
  handler in at module load, and ``main_logic/core.py`` can call the
  generic ``route_external_voice_transcript()`` without taking a
  reverse-direction import on ``main_routers``.

# Tuple key (not a `f"{lanlan}:{game_type}"` string):
#
# 1. String-concatenation with a `:` delimiter collides on inputs like
#    ``("a:b", "c")`` vs ``("a", "b:c")`` — a lanlan_name containing ``:``
#    silently maps to the wrong slot.
# 2. The prefix-style ``startswith(f"{lanlan}:")`` lookup over a stringified
#    key would also false-match: lanlan_name "Lan" prefix-matches "Lan2"'s
#    composite key. Iterating tuples and comparing the first element by
#    equality is unambiguous.
#
# Same-character supersede invariant: the router enforces that at most one
# active route per ``(lanlan_name, game_type)`` exists; ``/route/start`` for
# a new ``session_id`` finalizes the previous one before activating. So
# session_id intentionally does NOT enter the key — adding it would let two
