EmbeddingService — Tier 0 of the memory hierarchy: vector embeddings.

Provides ``embed(text)`` / ``embed_batch(texts)`` over the local CPU ONNX
text-retrieval embedding profile. Used by:

  * fact dedup at write time (cosine > threshold → LLM arbitration queue)
  * persona / reflection retrieval (cosine top-K → LLM rerank precandidates)

This module owns the *fallback gate*. The whole feature degrades to
zero-cost if any of the following holds:

  * ``onnxruntime`` cannot be imported
  * the ONNX model file is missing on disk
  * detected RAM < ``VECTORS_MIN_RAM_GB``
  * the user set ``VECTORS_ENABLED = False``
  * ``auto`` quantization when AVX-VNNI is **confirmed absent** (no INT8
    fast-path; default installs omit the large FP32 ONNX bundle — operators
    who need vectors then pin ``int8`` or ship FP32 weights + ``fp32``)
  * loading or any per-call inference raised an exception (sticky disable)

Explicit ``fp32`` loads ``model.onnx`` when present (manual / optional bundle).

When disabled, ``is_available()`` returns False; callers MUST check it
before invoking ``embed()`` / ``embed_batch()`` and fall back to the
pre-vector code path. The disable is process-local and final — once
``DISABLED`` we don't retry within the same process.

Lazy load: the model file is NOT loaded at startup. The
warmup is gated on the first ``request_load()`` call from
memory_server's post-ready hook (after the frontend has finished its
greeting / prominent drain). Until ``READY``, ``embed()`` returns None.

Embedding cache invalidation lives on the entry dict itself:

  * ``embedding``: list[float] | None
  * ``embedding_text_sha256``: str | None
  * ``embedding_model_id``: str | None

A reader treats the cached embedding as valid only when both fingerprints
match the current text + service ``model_id()`` — same pattern as the
``token_count`` cache PR-3 introduced.

# ── on-disk vector encoding ──────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A 256d float vector serialized as JSON ``list[float]`` runs ~5.3 KB
# (each float prints to ~21 chars after Python's repr). We instead
# store ``base64(fp16_bytes)`` — raw little-endian fp16 of the
# L2-normalized vector. Decode is:
#
#     raw = b64decode(s)
#     vec = np.frombuffer(raw, dtype=np.float16).astype(np.float32)
#
# Total bytes = ``2 * dim``; base64 ≈ ``ceil(2 * dim * 4/3)``. At 256d
# that is ~684 chars vs ~5.3 KB before — ~8× smaller, and the decoder
# lands in a contiguous numpy buffer so the recall path can stack
# candidates into a matrix and use ``M @ q.T`` instead of the pure-
# Python cosine loop.
#
# Why fp16 instead of int8: L2-normalized vectors have typical
# per-axis magnitudes ~1/√dim; in that range fp16's mantissa step is
# ~2⁻¹⁴ ≈ 6e-5, giving cosine error ~5e-4 over a 256-dim dot — well
# below LLM-rerank perceptibility. int8 with a per-vector scale would
# only buy 2× more compression but trade in quantization noise (~0.4%
# per dim, ~1% cumulative cosine), an extra fp16 scale prefix, the
# clip/round machinery, and a fresh attack surface around NaN scales.
# At our scale (small thousand-entry corpus) the marginal compression
# is invisible; simpler wire format wins.

    numpy probes CPU features in its compiled C core at import (for kernel

    ``{feature_name: bool}`` dict. We read it instead of calling py-cpuinfo
    because py-cpuinfo probes the CPU by generating a tiny native routine at
    runtime and calling into it from a child process — a low-level trick that
    antivirus heuristics (notably Huorong) match and act on, quarantining
    whichever Python file happens to be on the import stack at the time. The
    launcher starts the memory server as a spawn child that re-imports this
    module, so on Windows that file is ``embeddings.py`` — which is why the AV
    report blamed it (the report's ``--multiprocessing-fork`` line is that
    spawn child, not the probe). numpy's detection is pure compiled C with
    none of that, so the heuristic has nothing to bite, and numpy is already a
    hard dependency we import for inference. See PR #1437 / #1525 and this

        Sub-batching: ``texts`` arrives already capped by the worker's
