    Both sides of the near-duplicate check run through here, so index

    * Traditional characters fold to Simplified. Two renderings of the
      same sentence otherwise share almost no characters at all, which
      makes every character-level overlap score read them as unrelated.
    * Stop-names (master / catgirl and their nicknames) are stripped.
      They appear in nearly every fact; leaving them in lets two facts
      about entirely different things score as similar.
    * The text is split with the *same* rules as
      ``memory.hybrid_recall._tokenize`` — CJK runs become 2/3-grams,
      Latin runs stay whole. Sharing the rules keeps the dedup side and
      the recall side talking about the same units.

    Latin is lower-cased because unicode61 matches it case-insensitively:
    without this an ``USER LIKES CATS`` row is *retrieved* for a query of
    ``user likes cats`` and then scores 0, so a pair differing only in
    case looks less alike than two unrelated facts.

    Double quotes are dropped up front: a token carrying one would break
    the quoting of the FTS5 query built from it, and dropping it on both
    sides keeps the two in step.

    Combining marks are stripped for the same reason as the case fold:
    unicode61 matches Latin diacritic-insensitively, so ``José`` is
    retrieved for ``Jose`` and would then score 0 against it.

    Raises if the shared tokenizer cannot be imported. There is
    deliberately no fallback splitter: whatever this returns gets
    *persisted*, and a fallback that tokenizes differently would write
    rows the normal tokenizer can never match again — with the backfill
    marker claiming the index is complete.

    Note what raising costs on the write path: ``index_fact`` calls this
    outside its own ``try``, so the error reaches
    ``_apersist_new_facts_locked`` and rolls back the whole batch — the
    facts are not written at all, not merely left unindexed. That is the
    intended trade (the store's existing rule is that an index failure
    must roll back, or a retry hits dedup and reports a false success),
    but it is a heavier failure than "dedup degrades for a while".
