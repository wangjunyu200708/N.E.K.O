AntiRepeatCorpus — per-character rolling corpus + BM25 scorer for automatic
anti-repetition of AI output (unrelated to user behavior).

Motivation
--------
When generating proactive chats back-to-back, the LLM tends to circle back to the
same topic ("the tiger shows up again", "let's talk about ... again"). Simple
SequenceMatcher similarity only catches "exact repeats" and is useless against
"rephrased but still on the same topic".

We use BM25:
- background corpus = the most recent ``ANTI_REPEAT_BG_WINDOW`` AI outputs, each
  stored as an ngram set (count-capped only — never time-filtered, so IDF context
  survives idle periods intact)
- foreground query = the most recent ``ANTI_REPEAT_FG_WINDOW`` entries (a subset of
  the background, the trailing slice) that are ALSO within
  ``ANTI_REPEAT_FG_TTL_SECONDS``. TF/repetition is a recency signal, so a window
  left idle past the TTL empties and scoring returns 0 — this is what stops the
  proactive "idle deadlock" (frozen FG re-scoring the same high value every cycle
  because drop paths never advance the corpus)
- new draft score = Σ BM25(term, fg) over the draft's ngrams
- key property: frequent common words ("今天/觉得/哈哈/嗯") have high DF → low IDF →
  contribute almost nothing; topic words ("老虎/纳米机器/那个 bug") have low DF →
  high IDF → strong signal

Two paths share the corpus:
- proactive: total BM25 above ``ANTI_REPEAT_REGEN_THRESHOLD`` → trigger 1 regen;
  still above ``ANTI_REPEAT_DROP_THRESHOLD`` → drop this delivery
- regular reply: only inject the top-K BM25 ngrams into the next session's system
  prompt to tell the model "you've recently talked about X / Y / Z"; no hard block

Design notes
--------
- **Storage**: ``memory/{name}/anti_repeat_corpus.json``. Schema: see ``_default_payload``
- **Rolling**: on append, pop the oldest once over ``BG_WINDOW``; DF keeps no
  inverted index — every query linearly scans the BG once (N=100 scale,
  performance irrelevant)
- **Tokenization**: reuses ``memory.persona._extract_keywords`` (CJK 2/3-grams +
  Latin word split) and strips stop names. This is the project's only keyword
  extraction implementation; keep the single source of truth
- **Concurrency**: per-character ``threading.Lock``, pattern copied from ``memory/cursors.py``
- **Persistence**: every ``record_output`` writes to disk (same style as PR-1's user_directives)

Not extracted
------
- Too-short regular drafts (< ``ANTI_REPEAT_MIN_DRAFT_TOKENS`` ngrams): the BM25
  signal is unstable there, and short replies don't naturally "repeat"; pass
  with ``score=0``. The separate unanswered-proactive scorer uses its lower
  proactive-only threshold so concise reminders remain detectable.
- Empty corpus: BM25 degrades to 0; every draft passes

    Key difference from classic search-oriented BM25: classic BM25 scores "rare in
    corpus" high (search relevance prefers rare keywords), but **repetition
    detection** wants "rare in the background + frequent recently" — the former
    comes from IDF over the large BG window, the latter from accumulated TF over
    the small FG window. So:

    - ``bg_docs`` (default = fg_docs) computes DF/IDF: how many docs of the
      **full window** the term appears in
    - ``fg_docs`` computes TF: the term's cumulative frequency over the **most
      recent FG entries**
    - total = Σ_term IDF_bg(term) × Σ_doc∈fg BM25_tf_norm(term, doc)

    Examples:
    - "老虎" appears in all of the last 5 FG entries (5/5) but only in 5/100 of the
      BG → high IDF_bg + high TF → high repetitiveness; triggers regen
    - "今天" appears in nearly all 100 BG entries → IDF_bg near 0 → common words
      don't score
    - a stray unique term appearing once in FG → small TF accumulation → a single
      occurrence won't trigger

    Returns ``(total, per_term)``. ``per_term`` only contains positive
