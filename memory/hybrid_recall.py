Hybrid memory recall — BM25 + cosine embedding parallel retrieval with
Reciprocal Rank Fusion. The user-facing backend for the ``recall_memory``
tool that ``main_logic/core.py`` calls when the model emits a tool call.

Pool composition
================
- **BM25 pool**:      facts (active) + reflections (active) + facts_archive
  BM25 is cheap on small corpora; including archive lets the model surface
  long-tail keyword hits that have aged out of the live working set.
  Archived rows whose id is still active are dropped first — an interrupted
  archive commit leaves the row in both files (see ``_drop_archive_overlap``).

- **Embedding pool**: facts (active) + reflections (active)
  Excludes archive (cost + recency window) and *persona* (already rendered
  into system prompt every turn — re-surfacing it via recall is redundant).

Pipeline
========
1. Hard filter — reuse ``MemoryRecallReranker._hard_filter`` to drop
   ``score<0`` / suppressed / terminal-status reflections / protected
   persona (last one is a no-op since persona never enters the pool, kept
   for defensive parity).
2. BM25 path — tokenize query + each doc via ``memory.persona._extract_keywords``
   (2/3-gram for CJK, whitespace split for Latin — covers zh/ja/ko/en
   uniformly without per-language tokenizers), score with standard Okapi
   BM25, threshold-filter, take top ``HYBRID_RECALL_BUDGET_EACH``.
3. Cosine path — embed query via ``EmbeddingService``, compute cosine vs
   each doc with a valid cached embedding, threshold-filter, take top
   ``HYBRID_RECALL_BUDGET_EACH``. Docs without cached embeddings are
   simply skipped (unlike ``MemoryRecallReranker`` which keeps them at
   cosine=0 to fall through to LLM rerank — we don't have an LLM stage).
4. RRF fusion — for each doc in (bm25_top ∪ cosine_top):

       RRF(d) = Σᵢ 1/(k + rank_i(d))   (k = HYBRID_RECALL_RRF_K, default 60)

   docs absent from a retriever contribute 0 for that term. Sort DESC,
   cap at ``HYBRID_RECALL_BUDGET_TOTAL``.

Why no LLM fine-rerank
======================
``MemoryRecallReranker`` (the internal Stage-2 signal-detection pipeline)
runs an 8s-timeout LLM rerank after cosine coarse rank. We deliberately
skip that here — the ``recall_memory`` tool is in the model's tool-use
loop and the human is waiting; another LLM round-trip would make the
gap user-perceptible. RRF on two ranked lists is already a strong
fusion baseline and is what production hybrid search systems (Elastic,
OpenSearch, Vespa) use as default.

Tokenizer choice
================
``_extract_keywords`` uses character-level 2/3-gram for CJK and
whitespace split for Latin. This is **NOT jieba**, which only solves
Chinese — using jieba would silently degrade Japanese / Korean recall.
The 2/3-gram approach is consistent with ``memory.anti_repeat`` and
covers all seven supported languages (zh/zh-TW/en/ja/ko/ru/es/pt)
without per-language router complexity.

The one thing character n-grams do *not* survive is zh / zh-TW, because
the two scripts share a language but almost no characters: a fact stored
as 他对机器学习很感兴趣 and the query 他對機器學習很感興趣 overlap in a
single token, and a query written in the script the fact was not stored
in scores several times lower — or drops out at ``score > 0`` entirely.
Fact text follows the *conversation* language by design, so any user who
switched input methods has both scripts sitting in ``facts.json``.
``_tokenize`` therefore folds Traditional onto Simplified on both the
query and the document side before splitting (#2584, see
``memory.script_fold``). Word choice (用户 / 使用者) is a separate axis the
fold does not address — that one is the embedding path's job.

    word-split rules** as ``memory.persona._extract_keywords``, but *preserves
    multiplicity* (a list with duplicates, no dedup).

    Why not reuse ``_extract_keywords``: that one returns ``set[str]`` —
    duplicate terms within a doc get deduped → BM25's TF signal dies ("博士"
    appearing 5 times scores the same as once; BM25 degrades into BM1). The set
    semantics of ``_extract_keywords`` serve the ``_is_mentioned`` /
    ``anti_repeat`` use cases ("did it appear", not caring how many times),
    which differs from retrieval BM25's goal. So this module implements a local
    list-semantics tokenize whose splitting rules strictly mirror persona's
    (shared _SPLIT_RE + same CJK threshold + 2/3-grams + whole-Latin-run split);
    future changes to persona's tokenization must be synced here.

    Codex review #1 (commit fd2b75fc4): the earlier ``Counter`` optimization
    never took effect — with set input every key's count is 1. This version
    makes multiplicity actually reach BM25.

    stop_names: strip master/catgirl names from the text before tokenizing,
    keeping high-frequency entity names from polluting BM25 IDF.

    Traditional Chinese is folded onto Simplified first (#2584). Both the
    query and the documents come through here, so the fold is symmetric and
    never has to guess which script the user "meant" — it only has to make
    the two agree. It runs *before* stop-name stripping, and the stop names
    are folded with it, so a name configured in one script still strips out
    of text written in the other.

# ── cosine retrieval ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Decoded-vector cache
# ====================
# ``_POOL_CACHE`` (#2550) keeps the *parsed rows* resident across recalls; the
# cosine path nonetheless re-decoded every candidate's base64-fp16 embedding on
# **every query**. At 5000 rows that decode loop is ~49ms of the ~54ms cosine
# path (base64+fp16→fp32 ~32ms, per-vec ``np.isfinite`` ~7ms, sha256 ~4ms) —
# pure recomputation on a steady-state corpus where the vectors never change,
# and it all runs on the event loop, stalling every other request in the
# memory_server for its duration.
#
# So: decode once, keep the fp32 vector, and re-serve it only while the row in
# front of us is provably the row it was decoded from.
#
# The validity argument is a *delta* one, and that is what makes the hit path
# cheap. At admission time ``decode_valid_cached_embedding`` already returned
# non-None, which means all of its checks held **then**:
#
#     row['embedding_model_id'] == model_id
#     row['embedding_text_sha256'] == sha256(text)
#     decode(row['embedding']) is finite and has the model's dimension
#
# A hit therefore does not need to re-derive those facts — it needs to prove
# that none of their inputs moved since. Four comparisons do that:
#
#   1. ``model_id``            — same embedding space (dim/quantization/profile)
#   2. ``text`` **is** the cached object — identity, not equality. ``sha256`` is
#      a function of the object's bytes and ``str`` is immutable, so the same
#      object means the same hash, without hashing anything. Pool rows come from
#      ``_POOL_CACHE`` / FactStore's process cache and ``_tag_tier`` only
#      shallow-copies, so the ``text`` value object is stable across recalls;
#      a genuine reload hands us a fresh object and we simply miss.
#   3. row stamps unchanged — ``embedding_model_id`` still equals the runtime
#      model, ``embedding_text_sha256`` still equals the string we saw at
#      admission. A reloaded row can carry identical id / text / embedding
#      bytes with corrupted or missing stamps (hand edit, migration, cross-pool
#      id collision); the full validator rejects those, so a hit must too.
#   4. ``embedding`` str unchanged — the writer may have re-stamped the vector
#      itself (repair / requantize) without touching text or stamps. Compared
#      by equality; pool rows hand back the identical str object, so the
#      pointer check short-circuits the memcmp.
#
# (2)+(3) together re-establish ``stamp == sha256(text)`` from two string
# comparisons instead of a hash, which is why the steady-state path costs no
# sha256 at all — the ~4ms/query the old shape spent re-hashing 5000 rows to
# re-prove something that had not changed.
#
# Any mismatch falls through to the full ``decode_valid_cached_embedding``
# path, which applies the exact same checks plus the dimension/finite guards —
# a stale or hostile cache entry can therefore never smuggle a vector past
# validation, it can only cost one wasted probe.
#
# The row's L2 norm is cached alongside the vector for the same reason the
# vector is: it is a pure function of an unchanged vector, and recomputing it
# for the whole pool was another ~3ms/query at 5000 rows.
#
# Bounding — ``HYBRID_RECALL_VEC_CACHE_MAX_BYTES``, charged in bytes rather
# than entries because an entry also pins the row's ``embedding`` and ``text``
# strings (see the config note; entry count and resident bytes differ by ~2x).
#
# ⚠️ Admission is scan-aware, and it has to be. A plain LRU under "sequential
# full scan × pool larger than the cap" is self-destroying: each scan evicts
# the tail the previous scan just admitted, so by the time iteration reaches
# it the entry is gone — hit rate collapses to zero while every miss still
# pays admission. The guard is that a scan may never evict rows *it itself*
# touched this round: ``touched >= len(_VEC_CACHE)`` means everything resident
# belongs to this scan, and admission stops for the rest of it. A pool larger
# than the cap therefore settles on "the first N rows hit forever, the rest
# always miss" — degraded, but stable and strictly better than the bypass it
# replaces, which gave up caching for the whole pool.
#
# That guard is per-scan, so two characters alternating with a combined
# working set over the cap still evict each other and neither gets hits. What
# keeps that from being *worse* than no cache is the cost of a miss under this
# shape: one ``OrderedDict`` assignment and an integer add, no hashing, no
# extra decode. The pathological case degrades to "the cache does nothing",
# not "the cache costs more than it saves" — and it needs a corpus far past
# the point where archive sharding (#2716) is the actual answer.
#
# No lock, same reasoning as ``_POOL_CACHE``: dict ops are atomic under the
# GIL, and recall runs on the memory_server event loop.
#
# ⚠️ Same discipline as the pool cache: never hand out a stored vector that a
# caller could mutate in place. Consumers only read (``vstack`` copies), and
# this module never writes into a cached array after store.

#
# Per-file parse cache (#2550)
# ============================
# ``FactStore.aload_facts`` already keeps active facts in a process-level cache
# (``FactStore._facts``), so facts.json is parsed once per process. The other two
# pools had no cache at all and were fully re-read + re-parsed on **every**
# recall. That was survivable while recall was an on-demand desktop tool call;
# group memory (#2433) turned it into a per-turn cost multiplied by group message
# rate.
#
# Invalidation is by file identity — ``(st_mtime_ns, st_size)`` — not by hooking
# the write paths. That is deliberate: the "cache + invalidate on write" design
# would require auditing every writer in memory_server (and fact_dedup, and the
# archive sweeps, and the restore paths), and a single missed writer is a silent
# stale read. Every writer here goes through ``atomic_write_json``'s
# ``os.replace``, so the replacement always carries a fresh mtime; one ``os.stat``
# per recall (microseconds) buys correctness that does not depend on knowing the
# writer set. It also picks up edits made by other processes or by hand.
#
# Order matters: stat **before** load. Stat-then-load can only ever cache data
# *newer* than the identity it is filed under (next stat mismatches → reload).
# Load-then-stat would file stale data under a fresh identity and serve it until
# the next write — the one direction that actually goes wrong.
#
# Rows are shared, not copied — every consumer on the recall path treats them as
# read-only (``_tag_tier`` shallow-copies before stamping, ``_rrf_fuse`` copies
# again before adding ``_rrf_score``). Do not hand these lists to a mutating
# caller.
#
# Eviction: LRU capped at ``HYBRID_RECALL_POOL_CACHE_MAX_FILES`` entries.
# The original version of this cache had none, on the reasoning that entries are
# "bounded by (characters × 2 files)". That bounded the entry *count* while the
# thing needing a bound is *bytes*: every character ever recalled kept its whole
# archive resident forever, so a multi-character install paid for all of them at
# once even though only one is usually active. An LRU over entries fixes exactly
# that waste — idle characters fall out — without touching the active character's
# hit rate, which is where the latency win lives. Note this deliberately does NOT
# cap a single huge archive: evicting the active character's pool would just
# restore the per-recall re-parse this cache exists to remove. Bounding total
# corpus size is a different problem, tracked separately (archive sharding).
#
# No lock: two concurrent recalls can both miss and both parse, which wastes one
# parse but cannot corrupt anything (dict assignment is atomic under the GIL).
# A lock would serialize recalls across groups for no correctness gain.

# OrderedDict, not dict: eviction needs move_to_end / popitem(last=False).
