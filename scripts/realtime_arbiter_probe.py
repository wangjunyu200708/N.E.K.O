"""Measure how much margin a real provider leaves the arbiter's fail-close bounds.

Every bound in ``main_logic/omni_realtime_client/_response_arbiter.py`` was
chosen without field data, and each one tears the realtime WebSocket down when
it expires — which the user experiences as a disconnect and session rebuild.
Unit tests cannot settle whether a bound is right, because the provider in a
unit test is one we wrote. This probe asks the provider instead.

It drives the real ``OmniRealtimeClient`` rather than hand-rolling the wire
protocol. That is not incidental: the Lanlan free routes fingerprint the first
packet and reject anything that is not the application ("Invalid first packet:
you are not using Lanlan"), and more importantly the numbers are only worth
having if they came from the same handshake, session config and event sequence
production uses. A tap on the socket records every frame with a timestamp; the
client's own behaviour is untouched.

The arbiter's constants are imported rather than copied, so the margin table
stays honest if a bound is ever retuned.

Deliberately an opt-in development probe. Nothing imports it and no test runs
it. The free routes are sponsored capacity — the defaults here are small on
purpose; raise ``--turns`` deliberately, not by habit.

Scenarios
---------
baseline     N ordinary turns: create -> created -> done latencies.
bargein      ``cancel_response(wait=True)`` mid-reply, which is what a user
             talking over the answer triggers. Highest-frequency fail-close
             entry in production, and the one with the tightest bound (3s).
idle-cancel  Cancel with nothing running: what comes back, and does it carry
             an event_id the arbiter could have correlated?
soak         Long run counting turns whose ``response.done`` never arrived.

Usage
-----
    uv run python scripts/realtime_arbiter_probe.py --route tech
    uv run python scripts/realtime_arbiter_probe.py --route app --scenario bargein
    uv run python scripts/realtime_arbiter_probe.py --route tech --scenario soak \
        --soak-minutes 30 --json-out probe-tech.json

``--route tech`` is www.lanlan.tech (China free, StepFun-backed, server VAD);
``--route app`` is www.lanlan.app (international free, Gemini proxy, NO server
VAD — the only route where the deliberately unbounded speech-id rotation runs).
They exercise different arbiter paths and both are worth a run.
