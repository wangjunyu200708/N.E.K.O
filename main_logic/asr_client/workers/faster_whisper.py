"""Local faster-whisper segmented ASR worker.

The worker receives provider-neutral 16 kHz mono PCM16 chunks, buffers them by
session/epoch/utterance identity, and transcribes one utterance per manual
commit on the local machine. Endpoint selection (VAD / Smart Turn) remains the
caller's responsibility, exactly as for the cloud segmented workers.

Blocking work never runs on the event loop: importing ``faster_whisper`` (which
pulls in ctranslate2, av and tokenizers), loading or downloading model weights,
and decoding all happen in worker threads.

Model lifetime: loaded models live in a process-wide pool keyed by the
requested model spec. Every running worker holds one lease. When the last lease
is released the model is kept for ``_MODEL_IDLE_RELEASE_SECONDS`` so that the
per-turn reconnects done by resource optimization reuse it, then it is dropped
from a timer thread.

Weights are fetched by faster-whisper through huggingface_hub on first use,
which honors ``HF_ENDPOINT`` / ``HF_HOME``; this module never pins a mirror.
