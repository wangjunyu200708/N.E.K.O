"""Provider warm-up state owned by one worker queue.

Some providers need a one-off preparation step before they can transcribe
(a local model that is loaded, or downloaded on first use). That time is not
part of recognizing an utterance, so the runtime's provider-final watchdog
must not charge it against the per-utterance deadline. Like delivery evidence,
the state rides on the request queue the session and its worker share, so a
worker can publish it without a new event kind.
