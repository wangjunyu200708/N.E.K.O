        then ONE ``response.create``.

        One ticket, not one per result: the arbiter serializes tickets, so a
        per-result ticket let the first output's continuation start while a
        sibling's was still queued, and the model answered a parallel call
        whose output had not arrived yet.

        ⚠️ Provider differences:
        - OpenAI gpt / StepFun / Qwen / Free: ``call_id`` is required;
          the server uses it to bind the result back to the corresponding
          function_call.
        - GLM: the documented example shows function_call_output with
          **only an output field**, and the server's
          ``function_call_arguments.done`` carries no call_id either. The
          ``glm_<rid>_<idx>`` we synthesize at the done event is solely for
          internal registry tracking and must never be sent back to the
          server, or the request is likely to be rejected.
