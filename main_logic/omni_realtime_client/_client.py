class OmniRealtimeClient(_ToolingMixin, _AudioMixin, _TransportMixin, _ResponseMixin, _GeminiMixin):
    """
    A demo client for interacting with the Omni Realtime API.

    This class provides methods to connect to the Realtime API, send text and audio data,
    handle responses, and manage the WebSocket connection.

    Attributes:
        base_url (str):
            The base URL for the Realtime API.
        api_key (str):
            The API key for authentication.
        model (str):
            Omni model to use for chat.
        voice (str):
            The voice to use for audio output.
        turn_detection_mode (TurnDetectionMode):
            The mode for turn detection.
        on_text_delta (Callable[[str, bool], Awaitable[None]]):
            Callback for text delta events.
            Takes in a string and returns an awaitable.
        on_audio_delta (Callable[[bytes], Awaitable[None]]):
            Callback for audio delta events.
            Takes in bytes and returns an awaitable.
        on_audio_done (Callable[[], Awaitable[None]]):
            Callback for the provider closing this response's audio stream.
            Awaited strictly after the last audio delta of that response has
            been awaited, so downstream consumers can treat it as the
            authoritative end of playback for the current speech id.
            Only wired on the OpenAI-schema websocket loop; see
            ``_gemini_support`` for why Gemini deliberately never fires it.
        on_input_transcript (Callable[[str], Awaitable[None]]):
            Callback for input transcript events.
            Takes in a string and returns an awaitable.
        on_interrupt (Callable[[], Awaitable[None]]):
            Callback for user interrupt events, should be used to stop audio playback.
        on_output_transcript (Callable[[str, bool], Awaitable[None]]):
            Callback for output transcript events.
            Takes in a string and returns an awaitable.
        extra_event_handlers (Dict[str, Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], Awaitable[None]]]):
            Additional event handlers.
            Is a mapping of event names to functions that process the event payload.
        get_host_turn_id (Callable[[], str | None]):
            Reads the host's own notion of "which turn is live" — its speech id.
            Read-only and synchronous: ownership of the turn stays with the
            host, this side only samples it at a turn start and compares at the
            end (see ``_notify_turn_finished``). Left unset, the end-of-turn
            hooks behave exactly as they did before it existed.
