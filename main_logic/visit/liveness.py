"""Liveness timers of one visit (OD-11 v2, one rule per sentence).

``VisitLiveness`` is a pure timer set (``docs/design/visit-infrastructure.md``
PR-06 ``liveness.py`` and section 3.2.7): no await, no I/O, no lock; every
time value comes in through ``now``. The runtime feeds it transport events
and polls ``tick(now)``, which returns the first verdict reached (sticky) or
``None``:

* ``invite_expired``: host waited ``invite_wait_s`` (600 s) for a verified
  peer ``hello``; observing the peer entering the room extends the deadline
  to ``max(deadline, now + VISIT_JOIN_ALLOWANCE_S)``.
* ``peer_lost``: guest waited ``peer_lost_s`` (30 s) for the host ``hello``;
  or, after verification, no peer message for more than 30 s (suspended
  while a vendor-level leave of the peer is in its rejoin grace).
* ``declined``: guest got its ``hello`` acked but no ``ready`` within
  ``VISIT_ACCEPT_TIMEOUT_S + VISIT_ACTIVATION_ALLOWANCE_S +
  VISIT_READY_DELIVERY_MARGIN_S`` (85 s).
* ``relay_lost``: own connection down past ``min(disconnect + 25 s, last
  successful send + 30 s - VISIT_RECONNECT_MARGIN_S)``.
* ``local_page_lost``: a page reload missed its deadline. Two stages
  (design §4.8): while the transport WS is down, ``min(this drop + 20 s,
  absolute)``; once a new socket is back, the absolute deadline
  ``min(left + VISIT_PEER_REJOIN_GRACE_S - VISIT_PAGE_REJOIN_SAFETY_S, last
  successful send + 30 s - VISIT_RECONNECT_MARGIN_S)`` for the SDK reload
  and room re-entry. A deadline that already passed is never moved. The
  last-send term (also in ``relay_lost``) applies only once the peer acked
  our ``hello`` (``on_hello_acked``, both sides): only then does its
  heartbeat clock run on our messages. Before that a host bounds it by the
  guest's own 30 s wait (latest room entry + 27 s) while that wait was still
  running when the drop happened.
* ``peer_left``: authenticated ``leave`` (after the ``seq`` gap is filled or
  ``VISIT_LEAVE_GAP_GRACE_S`` expires), or a vendor-level leave not undone
  within ``VISIT_PEER_REJOIN_GRACE_S``.

``kicked{banned|room_disband}`` is finalized by the runtime directly and
vendor timeout events (TRTC reason 1, LiveKit disconnect without bye) are
left to the heartbeat clock.
