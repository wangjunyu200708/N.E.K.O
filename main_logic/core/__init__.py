This is the main logic file, responsible for managing the entire conversation flow. When TTS is not selected, the Omni model's native speech output is used via the OpenAI-compatible interface.
When TTS is selected, speech is synthesized through an extra TTS API. Note that the TTS API output is streamed and must interact with user input to implement interruption logic.
The TTS part uses two queues; one would normally suffice, but Aliyun's TTS API callbacks only support synchronous functions, so a response queue was added to asynchronously send audio data to the frontend.

Package layout (split from the former single-file ``main_logic/core.py``; the
import path ``main_logic.core`` is unchanged):

- ``_shared``: module-level constants, the package logger, and small pure
  helpers shared across the package.
- ``callback_render``: pure rendering helpers for agent-task callbacks and
  voice-swap injection strings.
- ``notices``: the prominent-notice buffer pool (single owner of the queue
  state).
- ``manager``: ``LLMSessionManager`` -- ``__init__`` (the single home of
  every instance attribute) assembled from the domain mixin modules
  (``context_append``, ``focus``, ``tts_runtime``, ``turn``,
  ``tool_calling``, ``lifecycle``, ``proactive``, ``greeting``,
  ``streaming``, ``notify``, ``takeover``), which hold methods only.
- ``__init__``: re-exports the supported compatibility surface of the old
  module so retained imports and test monkeypatches
  (``main_logic.core.<attr>``) keep working unchanged. Helpers explicitly
  retired by later refactors are not recreated as facade aliases. Mixin
  methods read supported test-patchable symbols late through this module's
  namespace (see the re-export block below), which is exactly what tests
  patch.

# Re-exports from the package submodules. Supported names retained from the
# old single-file module stay importable as ``main_logic.core.<name>``. A
# private helper deliberately replaced by a public contract API is not kept
# merely because the old module imported it at top level. Every remaining
# import in this file is intentional even though the class body no longer
# lives here (ruff F401 is not enforced on this facade).
#
# Rebind/monkeypatch semantics: ``LLMSessionManager`` methods live in the
# mixin modules, whose functions resolve globals against their OWN module
# dict -- rebinding a facade attribute does not reach them by default. Every
# test-patched target on this facade (``monkeypatch.setattr(
# "main_logic.core.<attr>", ...)`` and the ``setattr(core_module, ...)``
# form): CROSS_MODE_RESTART_WAIT_SECONDS, HIDE_DIRTY_VOICE_TRANSCRIPTS,
# _CONTEXT_APPEND_DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS, load/aload_global_conversation_settings,
# dispatch_text_user_message, is_livestream_active, process_screen_data,
# route_external_start_session,
# get_tts_worker, publish_analyze_request_reliably and
# publish_voice_transcript_observed_best_effort therefore keeps working
# through a different mechanism: the mixins do not from-import those symbols
# but read them late via ``_core_facade.<attr>`` at every call site. When
# adding a NEW patch target on this facade, route its mixin read points
# through ``_core_facade`` the same way -- a bare-name read in a mixin would
# snapshot the import and silently miss the patch. For symbols moved into
# other submodules (e.g. ``_loc`` inside ``callback_render``), patch that
# submodule directly -- same contract as ``main_routers/system_router``
# (#2148).
#
# State-carrying objects (the notice queue/lock, the
# proactive ContextVars, ``_notified_legacy_voices``) are re-exported by
# reference; their single owner is the defining submodule.
# ``notices._prominent_notice_seq`` is intentionally NOT re-exported: the
# owner rebinds that int on every enqueue, so a facade snapshot would go
# stale immediately (no external reader exists).
