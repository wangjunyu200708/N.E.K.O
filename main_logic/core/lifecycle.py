        """[Hot-swap related] Pick queued passive callbacks to ride the swap prime.

        Passive (``delivery_mode="passive"`` / ai_behavior="read") callbacks
        never mirror into ``pending_extra_replies`` (PR #2469), so a pure
        voice session has no user-turn drain to carry them. Their delivery
        point is HERE: the next NATURALLY-occurring hot swap hands them to
        the new session as background context. Non-Gemini providers get a
        DEDICATED ``prime_context(skipped=True)`` call (instructions channel,
        no turn) AFTER the announce prime — physically separate, so read
        content can never become part of the user turn that triggers a
        spoken response. Gemini has no instructions channel and a global,
        response-unscoped skip guard, so one swap may carry at most ONE
        prime turn: on a no-extras swap the passive block merges into the
        single ``skipped=True`` prime; a swap that also announces extras
        skips the ride-along and leaves passive queued for the next swap.

        Deliberate trade-off (owner decision): an ACTIVE voice session gets
        no mid-session context push for passive cues — they wait for the
        next natural swap, even if that is several user turns away. Pushing
        into a live session would reopen the interruption/session-churn
        surface this design exists to close.

        Returns ``(selected, rendered_text)``. Selection shares the
        ``AGENT_CALLBACK_TOTAL_MAX_TOKENS`` budget with the already-selected
        proactive extras: ``extras_selected`` is prepended to the candidate
        list before the budget walk, so passive only takes what the extras
        left over. Over-budget passive callbacks stay queued for the next
        swap (same semantics as the extras ``_deferred``).

        The queue is NOT drained here — removal is deferred to promote
        success via :meth:`_remove_swap_delivered_callbacks`. Selected
        entries are atomically marked provider-owned before this method
        returns, so enqueue coalescing, text drain, staleness sweeps, and the
        flood guard cannot retract them during the prime await. Every
        pre-promote exit releases that claim in the swap sequence's ``finally``
        block. Topic-hook snapshots are excluded: they have their own ack/retry
        lifecycle and delivery gates that this path must not bypass.
