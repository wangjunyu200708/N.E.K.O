        This is the correct channel for agent task notifications, greeting
        nudges, and any scenario where the AI should respond to a stage
        direction that must not pollute long-term context.

        Unlike ``prime_context`` (appends to system prompt, session start)

        - ``completion_mode="proactive"``:
          Uses ``on_proactive_done(content_committed)`` when available.
          This keeps the existing lightweight proactive / agent-callback
          completion path while exposing whether any content was actually
          emitted.
        - ``completion_mode="response"``:
          Uses ``on_response_done()`` so the reply goes through the
          regular user-visible completion path while still keeping the
          injected instruction itself ephemeral. ``response_done_callback``
          replaces it for this invocation only (the caller binds the
          completion to this reply), and runs whenever it would.
        - ``on_committed``:
          Called after visible text is confirmed but before completion
          callbacks flush proactive state.
        - ``on_committed_text``:
          Called at the same commit boundary with the sanitized visible text
          (nonverbal directives removed). Callback failures never fail the turn.

        Returns True if any user-visible text was generated, False if aborted

        instruction on the turn itself would let a stalled bridge hang the
        turn's teardown, so the wait lives here, inside the copy that is
        already off the response path.

        The instruction task swallows its own failures, so this only ever ends
        when it does -- and if it is cancelled (``close()``), that cancellation
        propagates and this reply is dropped with it. Correct: a reply on the
        bus with no instruction in front of it reads as a sentence with no
        cause.

        Waiting is not enough, though: the task **finishing** says nothing
        about whether the instruction was even sent. The publisher swallows a
        refusal and a raise alike, so the result is read here and a reply whose
        instruction never reached the socket is dropped rather than sent out
        carrying ``message_count=2``.

        agent-side ``_forward_conversation_turn``, the bridge, and ingest -- and
        the reply has already been released by the time any of them can drop
        the instruction. Closing that window for good needs an acknowledgement
        from the store hop, or publishing the pair atomically; neither belongs
        in this change.

        ``instruction_task`` is never ``None`` here -- the caller drops the
        whole reply in that case rather than publishing an orphan. The guard
        stays as a belt for a direct caller, and it is the reason the caller's
