"""Catgirl visit (cross-machine visiting) constants.

Single source of truth for every number of the visit infrastructure
(``docs/design/visit-infrastructure.md`` §4.8). Grouped by axis; each
assignment is followed by an English docstring naming its consumer. Env
overrides go through ``config.network._read_bool_env / _read_str_env``.

Cross-constant invariants that the design relies on are checked once at
import time (``_check_invariants`` at the bottom) so a later edit to one
