"""Startup order: the plane bridges come up before any plugin can push.

An autostart plugin may call ``push_message()`` from its startup hook, and
ProactiveBridge's SUB socket takes about a second to connect in its own thread.
PUB/SUB drops for an absent subscriber, so a push inside that window is never
spoken while ``push_message()`` has already answered ``submitted=True``.

Ordering NARROWS that window rather than closing it -- the connect delay is
still there, it just starts earlier. Closing it needs the bridge to signal SUB
readiness (or to backfill from the store), which is a separate change.

An earlier version of this docstring also claimed the plane bridge refuses
records before ``start_bridge()``. Measured: it does not. ``_Bridge._enabled``
reads the MESSAGE_PLANE_BRIDGE_ENABLED config flag once at construction, not
whether ``start()`` ran, so ``publish_record`` queues normally beforehand and
the thread drains it on start.

Pinned on the SOURCE order rather than by driving a real startup: the failure is
an ordering one, and what has to hold is that these three calls keep this
relative order. Driving it would need a whole plugin server.
