# enough — plugin children reach the host over their own per-host uplink and have
# no business on this socket.
#
# ⚠️ "never leaves this process" is NOT free, which an earlier version of this
# comment claimed it was. Plugin hosts are started with a bare
# ``multiprocessing.Process`` (plugin/core/host.py), so on POSIX they are
# FORKED — the child inherits this module already imported, with this exact
# token, and plugin code can simply ``import`` it and write authenticated deltas
# straight to ingest. That bypasses the per-host uplink's identity stamping,
# which is the whole point of routing plugin messages through the host.
#
# So the child re-mints. Its value then matches nothing the plane accepts, which
# is the correct outcome: the two legitimate readers (``_dumps`` here, and
# ServerLifecycleService handing it to the ingest server) both live in the
# process that starts the plane, and neither has a counterpart in a child.

    * ``payload_too_big`` -- the packed record exceeds
      MESSAGE_PLANE_PAYLOAD_MAX_BYTES. Ingest measures the same bound on the
      far side and would drop it there; measuring here means the failure is
      attributable and costs no queue slot and no socket write.
    * ``bridge_backlog`` -- the shared send queue is already
      MESSAGE_PLANE_FRAMES_BRIDGE_MAX_PENDING records deep. Not warned: it is
      ordinary host-side back-pressure, and the contract already says frames
      are dropped under load.

    ``False`` never means "retry". A frame that did not make it is simply gone;
    the next one is along shortly.
