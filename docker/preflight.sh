# a mount directory was created by Docker as root.

# Defaults: neko-home/ and logs/ next to this script, i.e. the sources used by
# docker-compose.yml. When an override file mounts other directories, pass the
# paths exactly as written there (not what `docker inspect` reports, which has
# already followed any symlink). Relative paths resolve against docker/, as in
# Compose, wherever this script is run from.
#
# Docker resolves a host symlink before mounting it, so the container cannot tell
# that /home/neko or /app/logs is really a shared host directory. The entrypoint
# therefore only chowns /app/logs while it is empty. This script runs where the
# symlink is still visible: it rejects mount sources that are, or go through, a
# symlink at any path component, creates missing directories, and sets the owner
# of each mount root (never recursively) to the container user. Data inside neko-home is aligned by the entrypoint on every start.
